// 40. Letâ€Ÿs first create the superclass Employee and define a method called calculateSalary() as an abstract method. 
//The Contractor class inherits all properties from its parent Employee but have to provide its own implementation of calculateSalary() method and 
//multiply the value of payment per hour with given working hours. 
//The FullTimeEmployee also has its own implementation of calculateSalary()method. In this case we just multiply by constant 8 hours.
